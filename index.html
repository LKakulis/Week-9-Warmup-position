        <h2>Mocha Decorated pottery</h2>
        <p>Mocha decorated pottery (also known as the " Mocha Tea " technique) is a type of dipped ware (slip-decorated, lathe-turned, utilitarian earthenware), mocha or mochaware, in addition to colored slip bands on white and buff-colored bodies, is adorned with dendritic (tree-like or branching) markings resembling the natural geological markings on moss agate, known as "mocha stone" in Great Britain in the late 18th century.</p> 
        <p>An unknown potter or turner discovered that by dripping a colored acidic solution into wet alkaline slip on a pot body, the color would instantly ramify into the dendritic random markings that fit into the tradition of imitating geological surfaces prevalent in the potteries of that period.</p>
        <p>The earliest known dated example (1799) is a mug in the collection of the Christchurch Mansion Museum in Ipswich, England.</p>
        <p>Archaeological excavations of the wreck of HMS Nymphe in Road Town Harbor on Tortuga in the British West Indies produced sherds of two earthenware vessels with dendritic markings on slip marbled surfaces.</p> 
        <p>The sloop was accidentally burned and sunk in 1783, giving an earlier date for this technique provided the sherds are from that wreck.</p> 
        <p>The context appears to support that supposition. Archival references are known that mention "mocoe beakers" as early as 1792.</p>
